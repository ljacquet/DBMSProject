# DBMSProject
API Created in .net 6 using entity framework as an ORM.

If you build in developer mode you will get swagger implementation that provides API testing and documentation.

## Building
I recommend downloading visual studio 2022 and using that to open the project. I'll try to include an exe that you can run as well.
