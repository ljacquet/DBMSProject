# Project
Backend Available in /API
Frontend Available in /WebDevProject

You will need visual studio 2022 to build the API (later versions may work I just haven't tested them)

Front end buildable through npm and built using angular

## Building
I recommend downloading visual studio 2022 and using that to open the project. I'll try to include an exe that you can run as well.
